# verbose-robot

Verbose Robot is a kubernets deployment for Photoprism, an app designed to help organize digital photos.
The design is set up to allow for a persistent volume to be attached for storage, so previous work can be saved.

## Some Notes:
- The application is exposed at port 2342.
- A secret is autogenerated for the administrator and saved as an opaque secret called verbose-robot PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- The Admin user is "TheRobot"
